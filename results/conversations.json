The causes of World War I are complex, and historians still discuss how each factor contributed. But here\u2019s a clear summary:\n\nThe **main immediate cause** of World War I was the **assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary** on June 28, 1914, by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo. This event triggered a chain reaction among European powers that quickly escalated into war.\n\nHowever, that assassination was just the spark \u2014 deeper, long-term causes had already created a very tense situation in Europe. Historians often group them under the acronym **MAIN**:\n\n1. **Militarism** \u2013 European countries had built up large militaries and believed in using them to solve problems.\n2. **Alliances** \u2013 Complex agreements bound countries to defend one another. Two major alliance systems had emerged: the **Triple Entente** (France, Russia, Britain) and the **Triple Alliance** (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy).\n3. **Imperialism** \u2013 Rivalries over colonies and global influence increased tension, especially between Britain, France, and Germany.\n4. **Nationalism** \u2013 Strong national pride and ethnic tensions made countries and groups more eager to assert their independence or dominance.\n\nSo, while the **assassination** set off the war, it was these deeper political, military, and social factors that made a large-scale conflict almost inevitable."

So the assassination was like the *trigger*, but there were already a lot of problems waiting to explode, right?  \n\nWhen I try to remember which causes go together, I use that \u201cMAIN\u201d thing \u2014 Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism, and Nationalism. I guess those built up tension, then the assassination just started the chain reaction.  \n\nIs it fair to say the *main* cause was the alliances, because that\u2019s what made so many countries join in? Or do teachers usually say it\u2019s the assassination?"
