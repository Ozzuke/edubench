These are two relevant diagnostic questions that reveal the student\u2019s mental model. However, the teacher does not explicitly restate the learner\u2019s goal or confirm constraints; thus, partial but not full diagnostic work.\nRetrieval Practice (0.0): There are no recall or memory-based prompts.

The teacher\u2019s questioning and feedback were strong, but there was little evidence of planning for long-term learning or motivation-building.\nFirst-Mile Diagnostics (2.0): The teacher asked one focused diagnostic question (\u201cwhat do you get when you multiply -2 by each term?\u201d) but did not explicitly confirm the student\u2019s goal, prior knowledge, or constraints.
